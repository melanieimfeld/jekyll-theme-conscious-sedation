...I am very glad you found your way here.

I am an Urban designer and thanks to a grant by the IKEA Foundation currently a student at the Centre for Advanced Urban Analysis at the University College London.
This blog is meant to document and practise what I am currently learning in my course. If you are interested in all other things I'm doing have a look at my **[website](http://melanie.imfeld.info/ "website")**.
