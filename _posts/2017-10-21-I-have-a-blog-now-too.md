![Hi there!](https://github.com/melanieimfeld/melanieimfeld.github.io/tree/master/assets/gif-hi.gif?style=centerme)
Oh yes! 
To make this blog I abandoned medieval Dreamweaver, briefly explored Drupal and then finally settled with Jekyll, a beautiful slim html website generator. As someone who has never used the commandline before it took me a while to wrap my head around it- but it was worth it! This is it, my biweekly blog about my current endeavours in London.
