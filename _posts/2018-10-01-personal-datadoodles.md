Inspired by the amazing Feltron report (here: http://feltron.com/FAR14.html), I am currently exploring my personal data. Although I didn't actively collect my own data last year, I was able to extract a surprisingly large amount of processable data, such as location data (see image), texts, health data and productivity. I started my exploration with the location data. I did some data preprocessing in Python to map my paths and total distance in Mapbox GL. I still want to indicate velocity or favorite longitude and latitude. Always open to processing/visualization suggestions!
