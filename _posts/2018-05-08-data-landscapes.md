Currently in the making: Data Landscapes in Unity 3D. The data shown above is crowdsourced data about light pollution in England from the <b> <a href="https://www.globeatnight.org/" >Globe at Night project</a> </b>. As the recordings are unequally distributed, the datapoints are interpolated on a 2000 x 2000 meter grid. The interpolated image is taken into Unity 3d where a grid of cubes is positioned along the z-axis based on the extracted pixel value.
Stay posted for further developments!
