##### Recently, I've been introduced to the so-called Fermi estimation, also known as Fermi question or Fermi problem. Named after famous physicist Enrico Fermi the Fermi estimation can be summed up like this: an educated guess is much better than a guess. Fermi was known for his ability to make good estimations with only little data. By dropping a sheet of paper Fermi was able to make a remarkably close estimate on the strenghth of the nuclear bomb tested during the Trinity test on July 16, 1945- solely based on the distance travelled by the paper. I deliberately chose a question that seems completely impossible to accomplish with any confidence.: #####

Fear not, I know as little as you about hoofed animals. Lets try to decompse the problem. I will try to make my estimation by obtaining more educated guesses about the following 

*   1) The amount of people on earth
*   2) The earth's surface
*   3) The total area of grassland on earth
*   4) The area a pony needs to live a healthy and happy life
*   5) The amount of ponies in the world


In a classic Fermi estimation an upper and lower bound are introduced to minimize the errors.
Scientists often look for Fermi estimates of the answer to a problem before turning to more sophisticated methods to calculate a precise answer. This provides a useful check on the results. While the estimate is almost certainly incorrect, it is also a simple calculation that allows for easy error checking, and to find faulty assumptions if the figure produced is far beyond what we might reasonably expect. By contrast, precise calculations can be extremely complex but with the expectation that the answer they produce is correct. The far larger number of factors and operations involved can obscure a very significant error, either in mathematical process or in the assumptions the equation is based on, but the result may still be assumed to be right because it has been derived from a precise formula that is expected to yield good results. Without a reasonable frame of reference to work from it is seldom clear if a result is acceptably precise or is many degrees of magnitude (tens or hundreds of times) too big or too small. The Fermi estimation gives a quick, simple way to obtain this frame of reference for what might reasonably be expected to be the answer, giving context to the results.
