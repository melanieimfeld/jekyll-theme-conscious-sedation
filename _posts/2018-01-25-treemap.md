This map was made with Mapbox using data of all public trees in the City of Zurich. The data can be found <strong> <a href="https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/baumkataster-der-stadt-zurich">here.</a></strong> I used Python to clean and explore the data: So there are 36.000 individual trees and 516 (!) species of trees on public ground in Zurich. The most common tree is the maple tree with 7163 trees. However, there is only one Japanese cork tree in the entire city. Have a look at the map <strong> <a href="http://melanie.imfeld.info/treemap.html" >here.</a> </strong>
