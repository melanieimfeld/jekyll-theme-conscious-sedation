A quick datadoodle using data on the percentage of female ministers in the years 2005, 2012 and 2015 in 36 different countries. The data set was downloaded from the OECD <strong> <a href="https://data.oecd.org/inequality/women-in-politics.htm#indicator-chart">website</a> </strong> and was minorly adjusted before it was loaded in Processing (I deleted unnecessary columns and made sure that each year has the same amount of listings). The GIF was created with Photoshop. You can find the source code <strong> <a href="https://github.com/melanieimfeld/Small_coding_projects/tree/master/women_in_politics">here</a> </strong>.
