I am currently preparing the building data from the City of Hamburg for some number crunching. We all know that 'form follows function', a mantra coined by the Chicago School at the beginning of the 20th century. Can we verify this by implementing an algorithm to predict function based on form characteristics such as area, complexity of shape and height? If so, which variables are the best predictors? Can we even go further and see if form is also able to predict the age of the building?
