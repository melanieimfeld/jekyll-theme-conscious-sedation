To make this blog I abandoned medieval Dreamweaver, briefly explored Drupal and then finally settled with Jekyll, a beautiful slim html website generator. As someone who has never used the commandline before it took me a while to wrap my head around it- but it was worth it! This is it, my biweekly blog about my current endeavours in London.
